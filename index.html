        <h3>Room Furniture Budget Automation</h3>
        <p>This project, developed for the AISG Student Hackathon 2021, leverages Python libraries PeekingDuck and TagUI RPA to automate the process of calculating budgets for room furniture based on specified themes. The system efficiently streamlines the budgeting process by extracting furniture options, calculating costs, and organizing the information to match desired room aesthetics. This solution highlights my expertise in integrating automation tools and developing streamlined workflows for complex tasks.</p>

        <h3>Carapace AI</h3>
        <p>In this project, my team and I labeled and trained datasets sourced from Kaggle to build a model using Yolov5 for detecting whether healthcare workers are wearing their personal protective equipment (PPE) properly. The system enables real-time monitoring to ensure compliance with safety protocols, enhancing workplace safety. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, apply machine learning techniques, and contribute to public health initiatives through AI-driven solutions.</p>

        <h3>Carefall Vision</h3>
        <p>This project, developed by my team and I for the Google for Startups Hackathon Singapore 2022, utilizes Mediapipe for pose classification and Google Cloud AutoML to predict fall severity. The system analyzes fall incidents to determine their severity and assess whether immediate medical attention is necessary. This project demonstrates my expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and the application of AI to healthcare solutions.</p>
